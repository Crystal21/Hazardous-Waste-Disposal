# Hazardous-Waste-Disposal
Created for eYRC 2015-16

Sorting of different colored hazardous wastes placed in city area ; according to colored flags placed in isolated area has been implemented using a Firebird V robot. The robot had to cross a bridge everytime it needed to sort and place a block. Weight blocks were used to balance the bridge and color sensors were used to detect the different colors.
